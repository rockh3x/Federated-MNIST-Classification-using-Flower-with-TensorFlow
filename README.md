ðŸ§  Phase 2 â€“ Your Program Description
We worked on:
Title:
ðŸš€ Federated MNIST Classification using Flower with TensorFlow
Goal:
Set up a basic federated learning simulation using the Flower framework, with:

A CNN model built in TensorFlow/Keras
Non-distributed (single-machine) simulation
Each client training on a local MNIST subset
Accuracy plotted per round

Structure:

model.py â€“ CNN definition
client.py â€“ Flower client with fit, evaluate, and get_parameters
server.py â€“ Custom server strategy (LoggingFedAvg) with accuracy logging
run_phase2.py â€“ Script to simulate clients
Used default IID data splits (in Phase 2)


This was the base we tested and successfully ran. It gave us a strong foundation to build:

Phase 3 â€“ Accuracy plotting, strategy tuning
Phase 4 â€“ Realistic non-IID simulation with partitioning and expanded metrics
